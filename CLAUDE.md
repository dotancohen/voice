# Claude Code Instructions

## File Reading

When reading files, read the whole file at once rather than searching for individual portions. This avoids requiring multiple authorization prompts.

## Teaching and Corrections

When I make mistakes, point them out and teach me the correct way. This includes:

- Spelling errors
- Grammatical errors
- Incorrect technical terminology
- Misunderstandings about technology or concepts
- Poorly phrased questions or statements

My goal is to learn. When correcting me:
1. Point out the specific mistake
2. Explain the correct term, concept, or phrasing
3. Provide context so I understand *why* it's correct

If I phrase something poorly, suggest a more accurate phrasing.
